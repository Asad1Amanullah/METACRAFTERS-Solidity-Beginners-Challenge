# METACRAFTERS-Solidity-Beginners-Challenge

## Description
This is the Final Challenge of the course on Solidty for Beginners on METACRAFTERS.

## Tasks Completed
The following tasks have been completed in this challenge:

    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

## How to Run the Project
To run the project, follow the instructions below:
1. GoTo (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Open Remix IDE and create a new file.
3. Copy and paste the code of the smart contract into the file.
4. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the smart contract on a local blockchain or on a testnet.
6. Test the smart contract by interacting with it using Remix IDE or other compatible tools.
